             <h3>Audi RS Landing Page
             </h3>
             <p> 
              I successfully created an impressive landing page for the Audi RS 3 model, featuring three unique designs. Each design has its own dedicated page, which changes color based on user selection. My implementation of HTML, CSS, and JS was integral to creating an engaging and interactive experience for Audi's marketing campaign. The resulting landing page was highly effective in capturing visitor attention and yielding favorable results.

              I am delighted to share that I have developed a dynamic live clock application that features both digital and analog clock designs. The application was meticulously designed using Processing technology and is fully responsive to the user's location on their device. This application showcases my adeptness at creating innovative applications that effectively merge form and function.

              I skillfully created an engaging Rock Paper Scissors game that enables users to play against the computer. The game is designed to provide players with a seamless and intuitive experience, allowing them to make their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors and receive immediate feedback on whether they have won or lost. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS, I was able to craft an effective and visually pleasing game that is sure to impress any user.
